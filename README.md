# MDI230

This module is an introduction to queueing theory with a mathematical approach: Markov
processes, their generator, their properties and their characteristics. You will learn how to model
telecommunication systems as well as supply chains, the cloud, architecture for online real time
games, etc. Then, you will learn how to compute the main numerical features of these models.
Applications will focus on the dimensioning of mobile networks but also on epidemiology, random
graphs, etc.
